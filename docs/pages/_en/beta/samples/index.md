{% include ltr/warning_note.html note='Keep in mind that this project is in beta and does not fully cover all functions of the Revit API in its custom Revit components. Many of the guides and examples in this Wiki, use custom python components to create the necessary functionality. You are, however, free to grab the python components in these examples and use them in your own Grasshopper definitions.' %}
