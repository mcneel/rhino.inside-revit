## Sharing Your Discoveries

Each discover page listed here, is a self-contained article on a specific topic. They also might have a ZIP package attached that includes one or more files (e.g. Sample Screenshot `*.png`, Grasshopper Definition `*.gh`, Rhino Model `*.3dm`, Revit Model `*.rvt`, Revit Family `*.rfa`)

Visitors can download the archive for each article by clicking on the download button included on the page. You can create your own articles, following a similar format, and send us the markdown file of the article, plus all the images and attachments in a package and we can add them to this page. You can also follow the [wiki guidelines]({{ site.metawiki_url | prepend: site.repo_url }}) and submit a PR with your content.
