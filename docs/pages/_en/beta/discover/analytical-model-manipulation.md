## Files

- **rst_basic_sample_project.rvt** Revit sample model. This model is shipped with Revit by default.
- **structural_revit_to_rhino.gh** Grasshopper definition

Open Sample files:

1. Open the sample Revit model
2. Start {{ site.terms.rir }} and open Rhino and Grasshopper windows. Open **structural_revit_to_rhino.gh** in Grasshopper

## Description

This example takes a look at working with Revit analytical models using {{ site.terms.rir }}. Often, building engineers, need to bring analytical information together from multiple sources. Rhino and Grasshopper can be used as the platform to extract and convert the data from various sources. {{ site.terms.rir }} specifically help extracting from, and updating information from Revit models.
