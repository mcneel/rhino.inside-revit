{% capture breaking_changes_notes %}
Some of the changes mentioned in sections below, might break your existing Grasshopper definitions. We hope this should not be causing a lot of trouble and rework for you, since in most cases the older components can easily be replaced by new ones without changes to the actual workflow. As always, if you have any issues with loading **Rhino.Inside.Revit** or any of the components, take a look at the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _en/beta/reference/toubleshooting.md %}) or head out to the [Discussion Forum]({{ site.forum_url }}) to reach out to us. We do our best to resolve the bugs and software conflicts and need your help to make this product better for everyone.

<!-- most recent release should be on top -->
{% include ltr/release-header.html version="0.0.7688.36802" time="01/18/2021 20:26:44" %}

### Fixes
* Now is possible to transfer geometry with short-edges.
* Added geometry conversion errors feedback to some components.

{% include ltr/release-header.html version="0.0.7683.19842" time="01/13/2021 11:01:24" %}

### Fixes
* Fixed 'Set Element Parameter' casting from integer.

{% include ltr/release-header.html version="0.0.7679.63" time="01/09/2021 00:02:06" %}

### Fixes
* Now Rhino.Inside Revit resolves at load time any dependency on assemblies installed with Rhino.
* Isolated 'opennurbs.dll' installed with Revit from 'opennurbs.dll' installed with Rhino.

### Changes
* Now installer needs admin privileges. Please remember to manually uninstall any previous version of Rhino.Inside Revit you already have installed before applying this new one.

### Important Note

This release is a major update to {{ site.terms.rir }}. This build attempts to resolve the loading and runtime errors some have experienced in Revit. It would be great if you could download and install this new version to see if it solves all the load problems.

Because this is a major change, it does require additional steps to install properly:

1. Make sure Revit is closed
2. This step is quite important üëâ: Uninstall any previous versions of {{ site.terms.rir }} through **Windows Control Panel > Programs & Features**
3. [Download the latest {{ site.terms.rir }}](https://www.rhino3d.com/inside/revit/beta/)
4. Install the new {{ site.terms.rir }}. This new installer requires administrator privileges to install properly

Any feedback to this new build is welcome on the [{{ site.terms.rir }} Forum]({{ site.forum_url }})

### Why are admin privileges required to install now?

In order to isolate OpenNURBS Library (`opennurbs.dll`) that is deployed by Revit from the library deployed by Rhino we do need to install a manifest file (`opennurbs_private.manifest`) inside the Revit main folder, and this requires administrator privileges. This change does not affect the Revit installation or behavior in any other way. It only directs Revit to use its own version of the OpenNURBS library when importing 3DM files. Please remember to manually uninstall any previous version of {{ site.terms.rir }} you already have installed before applying this new one.

### What‚Äôs new about .NET conflicts in this release?

Normally users have a myriad of Revit add-ons installed to support their specific workflows. Since we can not test every possible setup the user may have, we have tried in this release to make the Rhino.Inside load process more robust to handle ‚Äúany‚Äù unexpected circumstance like conflicts with other installed add-ons.

- One of the major additions in this release is the Document-aware components. These components can query information from all the active documents at the same time so you can analyze and compare projects easier.

![]({{ "/static/images/release_notes/2019-04-0103.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

- The new Rhino.Inside.Revit have also improved the geometry transfer logic between Rhino and Revit in both directions and improved the edge tolerance and trimmed curve conversion as well. This will allow more geometry to pass between Rhino and Revit as a Brep Solids.
  - Degree 2 curves with more than 3 points are upgraded to degree 3 to fulfill the Revit requirements
  - And Curves that are not C2 are approximated moving the knots near the discontinuity
  - Curves are scaled on the fly without copying to improve performance. This means on Rhino models in mm that should be converted to feet in Revit is done without duplicating the curve

- If you have been following the project closely, you might have noticed that we had included a large collection of python components to get you started with different workflows using the Revit API. In the meantime, we have been testing out the methods and ideas behind these components and happy to announce that we have started porting them into the Rhino.Inside.Revit source code. This would standardize the workflows and improve the performance of your Grasshopper definitions.

- Automatically disable active Grasshopper Document when we lost access to Revit API. This means Grasshopper timers will be disabled until we get access back.
